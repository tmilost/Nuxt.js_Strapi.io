# Assessment

The assessment will be the following:

- Create a very simple version of a backoffice tool that a business can use internally to manage their day-to-day business.
- You will be building the following:
    - An admin should be able to login, **********************************************************no need for password reset or e-mail confirmation**********************************************************. We can create the user in the Strapi backend so no need for front-end user creation either.
    - The bearer token of the admin should be set as cookie so their login session is preserved.
    - Once logged in the admin should see a [tabbed layout](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_tabs.asp) (their dashboard) where they can press trough.
    
    ## Tab one
    
    - **Tab one** should be a list view of ********Item******** which you will create in Strapi. Each ****************************************************item contains the following:****************************************************
        - Name (text)
        - Date (datetime)
        - Important (Boolean)
    - At the bottom of the list it should be possible to add a new item. Use GraphQL by preference and Strapi to create them. Make sure to read up on strapi permissions for logged in users, otherwise you will get a 401.
    
    ## Tab two
    
    - **************Tab two************** should contain a ‚Äòedit my profile‚Äô form. This should contain the following:
        - First name (create this field on the strapi user as it‚Äôs custom)
        - Last name (create this field on the strapi user as it‚Äôs custom)
        - E-mail address
        - Password
        - Biography (Textarea)
    - It should be possible to logout from this tab as well, so add a logout button. Make sure to clear the cookie and return to login screen.
    
    ## In general
    
    - Use your own GIT provider and share the repo with me at the end.
    - Make sure only authenticated users can access the dashboard, use nuxt middleware for that to check if the user is logged in, if not redirect to login page
    - Make the requests yourself using apollo/axios. Do not use the strapi module for Nuxt to authenticate as this does not allow you to showcase your apollo/axios skills.
    - I mostly use GraphQL, but it‚Äôs a pre if you can use both GraphQL and REST. So it would be cool if you can use GraphQL for the ********Item******** management and REST for the user edit form.
    - Use the ****************latest Strapi version**************** for the backend and make sure to use ****************postgres****************, no mysql.
    - I use **Nuxt/Vue 3+** (latest) for my **new** projects but use **Nuxt 2.17.1** for my **existing** projects. Moving with my existing projects from Nuxt 2 to Nuxt3 is time consuming and something I have not done and might never do. It‚Äôs up to you which one to use for this assessment.

    üí° It‚Äôs a plus when you do it in Typescript by using interfaces etc.
